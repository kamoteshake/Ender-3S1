# Custom Ender 3 S1 Plus Firmware
This is my "stable" build for my personal Ender 3 S1 Plus. I used to use Synman's rebased firmware but there were some bugs. I use this firmware if I want to just print and print reliably. I use the [custom/s1-plus-bugfix-2.1.x](https://github.com/kamoteshake/Ender-3S1/tree/custom/s1-plus-bugfix-2.1.x) as my sandbox. This firmware may not work with your machine. Please read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Upgrades
Here are the upgrades I installed on my Ender 3 S1 Plus.

| Upgrade | Details | Firmware Changes |
|---------|---------|:-----------------------:|
| [Heater Block Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B2DN5SKD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) | This comes with a bi metal throat to allow me to print up to 300&deg;C | âœ… |
| Hardened Steel Nozzle | I was printing PETG and it loved to stick to brass. I put this nozzle to prevent PETG from hugging the nozzle and to future proof my machine just in case I decided to print abrasive materials. | â¬›
| [Zuff's Cold-end Duct with Probe No Y Offset](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-s1-pro-4020-fan-cr-touch-no-y-offset) | This moves the CR Touch to be inline with the nozzle on the Y axis. I also installed a [4020](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L2XZKS7?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) blower fan<sup id="4020-note-mark">[[1]](#4020-note)</sup> for the cold-end. | âœ… |
| [Zuff's 5015 Part Cooling Duct](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/air-duct-5015-ender-3-s1-pro-v3) | Installed this to reduce the high pitch whine of the stock fan. Using [5015](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079BPS9Q8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), I can reduce the part cooling fan to 80%. | â¬› |
| [Silicon Spacers for the Heat bed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Y89KS9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) | Just wanted to put more tention so the bed tramming wheel doesn't loosen up much. | â¬› |
| [PEI Bed Surface](https://www.creality3dparts.com/product/power-coated-pei-plate-kit-for-ender-3-s1-plus-cr-10-smart-cr-10-smart-pro/)<sup id="pei-note-mark">[[2]](#pei-note)</sup> | I abused the stock PC spring steel so I had to replace it. PEI is worth the cost. The prints stick well and comes off easily. Easier than the stock PC spring steel. | â¬› |
| [Extruder Cable Stress Relief](https://www.printables.com/model/281061-ender-3-s1-cable-holder) | Just a way to reduce the stress on the extruder ribbon cable.  | â¬› |
| [X Stepper motor and Limit Switch Stress Relief](https://www.printables.com/model/328521-ender-3-s1-ribbon-cable-holder) | This one is for the thin wires for the X stepper motor and limit switch | â¬› |
---
<sup id="4020-note">[1]</sup> I couldn't find a way to reduce the speed on the firmware side. It seems like there's a bug or an issue somewhere. I've tracked all of the things I tried in this [issue](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/Ender-3S1/issues/46) post in Creality's repo. I had to put an inline resistor to slow the 4030 down. [â†©](#4020-note-mark)

<sup id="pei-note">[2]</sup> The CR-10 Smart have the same bed size as the S1 Plus (310mm x 315mm). I Bought one and it fit perfectly. [â†©](#pei-note-mark)
